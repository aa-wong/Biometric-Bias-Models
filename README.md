# Biometric Bias - Models and Data Set
This repo contains all jupyter notebooks created during the development of the biometric bias models. All coded in python 3 using Keras, pandas, scikit-learn, PlaidML and tensorflowJS. This repo showcases and documents the process in scrubbing the data, creating the model in python and converting it to the tensorflowJS model that would ultimately be used in the client-side.

Client side project can be found here: https://github.com/aa-wong/Biometric-Bias-Client

# Live demo
